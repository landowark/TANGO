"Processing\", IEEE Computer, January 1983.\n" +
"\n" +
"Imagine that the 2D grayscale image has a third (height) dimension by the image\n" +
"value at every point in the image, creating a surface. A ball of given radius is\n" +
"rolled over the bottom side of this surface; the hull of the volume reachable by\n" +
"the ball is the background.\n" +
"\n" +
"With \"Sliding Parabvoloid\", the rolling ball is replaced by a sliding paraboloid\n" +
"of rotation with the same curvature at its apex as a ball of a given radius.\n" +
"A paraboloid has the advantage that suitable paraboloids can be found for any image\n" +
"values, even if the pixel values are much larger than a typical object size (in pixels).\n" +
"The paraboloid of rotation is approximated as parabolae in 4 directions: x, y and\n" +
"the two 45-degree directions. Lines of the image in these directions are processed\n" +
"by sliding a parabola against them. Obtaining the hull needs the parabola for a\n" +
"given direction to be applied multiple times (after doing the other directions);\n" +
"in this respect the current code is a compromise between accuracy and speed.\n" +
"\n" +
"For noise rejection, with the sliding paraboloid algorithm, a 3x3 maximum of the\n" +
"background is applied. With both, rolling ball and sliding paraboloid,\n" +
"the image used for calculating the background is slightly smoothened (3x3 average).\n" +
"This can result in negative values after background subtraction. This preprocessing\n" +
"can be disabled.\n" +
"\n" +
"In the sliding paraboloid algorithm, additional code has been added to avoid\n" +
"subtracting corner objects as a background (note that a paraboloid or ball would\n" +
"always touch the 4 corner pixels and thus make them background pixels).\n" +
"This code assumes that corner particles reach less than 1/4 of the image size\n" +
"into the image.\n" +
